== Thanks to our collaborators

CodeWomen::
Is an empowering and supportive community for women, by women.
Our goals are offering women learning, encouragement and support.
In addition, CodeWomen offers its members a safe environment to share their plans, ambitions and questions with each other.
By building this community, CodeWomen stimulates both professional and personal growth.
CodeWomen is a unique place for women career changers, specifically for women with a migration background, to learn and network, meet new people, and get career advice from experienced women developers.
Learning from other women and working with women coaches is an important part of the learning we offer.

Step4ward::
Is a group of volunteer mentors that helps women starting within the tech world by making a career change or want to continue improving their knowledge and experience.
Currently, we are under the BCN ENG Slack community, and we offer from 2-3 sessions with each mentee to get to know their needs and work with a plan, we know that only with those sessions there won‚Äôt be a huge improvement, but talking with other people that already have a path in tech and even that have lived the same situation gives them the courage to continue and help them with the anxiety of the process.
We do our session fully remote and are specialized in the Spanish tech market.
