      "abstract": "With microservices architectures, we're making more network calls and need to do more integration to get our system to work; this creates more ways for our applications to break and cause failures to propagate much faster. We need a way to call our microservices and be resilient to distributed systems failures â€” as a first-class implementation.\n\nPrevious generations of tools solving these problems were built at Twitter or Netflix but did so with application libraries. However, for each combination of platform/language/framework we use to build microservices we need to consistently solve for the following critical functions\n\n* routing / traffic shaping\n* adaptive/clientside loadbalancing\n* service discovery\n* circuit breaking\n* timeouts / retries \n* rate limiting\n* metrics/logging/tracing\n* fault injection\n\nDoing all of these things in application-layer libraries across all your languages and all your frameworks becomes incredibly complex and expensive to maintain. In this talk, I'll introduce you to Envoy Proxy and Istio.io Service Mesh, discuss how they solve these problems more elegantly by pushing these concerns down to the infrastructure layer, and show demos of how it all works.

      "abstract": "Kotlin is a language for the JVM, invented by JetBrains a few years ago. But what the hell is Kotlin EE? If you never heard of Kotlin EE, don't panic, it does not exist. But you can use it right away and boost your productivity!\n\nI invented the term Kotlin EE as a synonym for using the Kotlin language together with the Java EE API to create services of any size (microservices, nanoservices etc.) with just a few lines of code and the ability to focus on the business logic.\n\nKotlin and Java EE are a perfect couple for writing micro- or nanoservices. Kotlin is a very pragmatic language, builds on many concepts and techniques from Java, designed for developer productivity. Kotlin works great with all existing Java libraries and frameworks and runs with the same level of performance as Java.\n\nThe Java EE API allows us to code against a proven and stable API. Provided libraries like JAX-RS for writing RESTful APIs and Jackson for JSON (de)serializing decrease the need for additional third-party libraries which results in a short build time and a small artifact size. Benefit from a very fast build and test feedback and stay focused on your code.\n\nIn this talk, I try to prove my statements from above. Live on stage I write a service in Kotlin with a RESTful JSON API with only a few lines of code and run the service using a local Docker cloud where you can see how these can be scaled up and down to manage fluctuating loads.

In this talk I will present three challenges we observed in real-life projects and discuss how to avoid them.\n\n1. Communication is complex. With everything being distributed failures are normal so you need sophisticated failure handling strategies (e.g. stateful retry).\n2. Asynchronicity requires you to handle timeouts. This is not only about milliseconds, systems get much more resilient when you can wait for minutes, hours or even longer.\n3. Distributed transactions cannot simply be delegated to protocols like XA. So you need to solve the requirement to retain consistency in case of failures.\n\nI will not only use slides but also demonstrate concrete source code examples available on GitHub.",

Java is deliberately built from the ground up on a modular basis: Methods, classes, packages. Additionally, the module system was introduced in Java 9. Modularity is based on three pillars: high cohesion, low coupling and strong encapsulation. We will look at these three basic concepts in detail – what are they, how are they related to one another and how can we apply them on all levels of our architecture?\nThe talk will show you how you can apply these basic concepts to develop a clean, monolithic architecture at scale, based on Java 9 modules and the hexagonal architecture pattern.\nFinally, we will critically discuss microservices. We'll look at what microservices are, as well as at their advantages and disadvantages. We'll examine the technical and organizational requirements necessary for implementing a microservice architecture. Additionally, we'll explore when we should and shouldn't make use of microservices.

I will show and explain to you what GraphQL is, how we can build GraphQL API in good old Java, when and why you should use GraphQL, and also when and where not to use GraphQL. Come seeking knowledge, and you will leave this workshop with new tricks in your bag and great knowledge of GraphQL.",

      "abstract": "Can a billion-tone spaceship change direction in space by simply turning a wheel? Can an astronaut survive a launch at 10g? Should we expect a space invasion from a planet located 90 billion light-years away? Can humans live on Mars?\nNever has a film director dared place a mobile phone in the court of Henry VIII. In sharp contrast, the ships of Star Wars roar in the vacuum of space, fire colorful laser beams, and remain in flames for hours after a fatal encounter, without awaking a single criticism. Our society is, more than ever, intertwined with technology, such that we daily rely on GPS devices, MP4 players, microwave ovens, and laptops. Indeed, science and technology are a critical component of our culture, and yet, we do not fully trust (and little understand about) science and technology.\nIn this talk we will explore science facts in science fiction. The audience will be kindly requested to fasten their seat belts for a fascinating trip to the mysteries and wonders of science at the crossroads with fiction.",

      "title": "Production Profiling: What, Why and How",
      "abstract": "Everyone wants to understand what their application is really doing in production, but this information is normally invisible to developers. Profilers tell you what code your application is running but few developers profile and mostly on their development environments. Thankfully production profiling is now a practical reality that can help you solve and avoid performance problems.\n\nProfiling in development can be problematic because it’s rare that you have a realistic workload or performance test for your system. Even if you’ve got accurate perf tests maintaining these and validating that they represent production systems is hugely time consuming and hard. Not only that but often the hardware and operating system that you run in production are different from your development environment.\n\nThis pragmatic talk will help you understand the ins and outs of profiling in a production system. You’ll learn about different techniques and approaches that help you understand what’s really happening with your system. This helps you to solve new performance problems, regressions and undertake capacity planning exercises.",

      "abstract": "With Java 9 and later, modularity comes to your doorstep (whether you ordered it or not). This isn’t your average language feature: making the most out of it may involve rewiring your brain. In this session we explore the benefits of a modular codebase using Java  modules. Because who doesn’t like more reliable and secure applications, meanwhile killing the dreaded classpath?\n\nAfter reviewing the basic concepts of modules, we’ll explore other new features like services and linking that enhance your design and development skills. Want examples? We’ve got plenty in this practical and code-driven talk. Even if you intend to use Java without modules at first, this talk helps you prevent common issues. You’ll be ready for the modular future of Java before you know it.",
