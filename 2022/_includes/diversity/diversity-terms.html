            <p>JBCNConf, its volunteers, and staff consider that understanding, respecting, valuing and promoting differences is an essential part of our core values.
                Since we believe that everyone is unique, in our events we actively encourage collaborative environments where individuals can confidently share their different ideas.
                We are also committed to embrace the rich diversity of our society and the world around us.
                People who are diverse in nationality, age, race, ethnic origin, spiritual beliefs and practices, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, work and life status are critical for
                constant improvement and innovation in our profession.</p>
