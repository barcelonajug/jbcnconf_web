As mentors, we believe in the given value through the feeling of belonging to a community. We encourage our mentees to build their career path, by guiding them and teaching all the available tools. The most important part for us is letting them know that they are not alone, there are more women like them, and us in the same situation during their career evolution.
As a community, we also want to create alliances and partnerships with other groups and communities with similar initiatives and spirits in the tech world. "
