GitOps allows us to establish Git as the only point of interaction with the system. Crossplane Composites enable us to simplify developer experience when managing infrastructure. Finally, the Open Application Model (OAM) with KubeVela allows us to define applications instead of Kubernetes resources.

How can frameworks like Spring not only make your life easier but help your teams deliver robust applications to production? Spring Cloud has a veritable plethora of sub projects from circuit breakers to functions simplifying the task of building cloud native applications while making it easy for developers to adhere to best practices. At the same time it can be overwhelming to get your head wrapped around all the features Spring offers. This talk will show how Spring allows architects to focus on the critical design decisions they need to make while ensuring developers are empowered to implement critical business use cases. Today’s cloud native applications have similar pitfalls, luckily Spring is here to help you resolve them!</p>",

We will see how it works closely with and relies on Apache Bookkeeper for its durable, scalable, and performant storage of log streams, and leverages on Apache Zookeeper to manage the otherwise very complex ecosystem.  We will then compare Apache Pulsar with the popular Apache Kafka platform to understand some of their key differences as to how Pulsar can overcome some of Kafka's limitations.

More than ever, we need to have a tool to easily create decoupled and easy integration connectors between several external systems. But more importantly, we need to be able to scale those into the Cloud.</p><p>Apache Camel with its 350 connectors gives a proven response to such a demand. In this talk, we will present Apache Camel and explain how to scale Apache Camel based microservices to the cloud. We will present how to make your Camel, Camel Quarkus and Camel K solutions to make them more scalable, high-performing, and observable.</p>",
