                                    <strong><a href="https://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2022/04/20/pdfs/BOE-A-2022-6449.pdf">Date 25/4/22</a>:</strong>
                                    <strong>Since 20/4/22, it is no longer mandatory to wear masks in enclosed spaces in Spain.</strong>
                                    In-person congresses, conventions, trade fairs and similar activities in enclosed spaces require that
                                    the minimum ventilation levels set out in the current regulations on thermal installations of
                                    buildings be guaranteed.

                                    When there are more than 1,000 people in attendance at such events:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Compliance with enhanced ventilation and air quality conditions is recommended.</li>
                                    <li>Crowd control measures must be put in place, both indoors and outdoors.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3>Regulations and guidelines</h3>
                                <p>For all our events, including conferences, workshops, and social events, we take the COVID-situation
                                    seriously. We want to reduce the risk of infection as much as possible, and keep everyone safe.</p>
