      "title": "OOP v̶s̶ and FP ",
      "abstract": "Object Oriented Programming dominated the software development landscape in the last decade of XX century and in the first of XXI. In more recent years, even as a consequence of the advent of multicore CPUs, Functional Programming and its principles started attracting more interest, becoming at least equally relevant in our industry. The biggest mistake made by programmers nowadays is considering OOP and FP as two mutually exclusive paradigms. This misconception is also the product of a misunderstanding about what OOP actually means and its founding principles. The biggest pros of OOP are polymorphism and encapsulation while FP strengths are immutabilty and its declarative style, but these features are orthogonal and there's no reason why they cannot coexist in the same program. The final purpose of this talk is twofold: debunking the misconceptions on OOP and showing that OOP and FP are actually complementary techniques that can happily coexist in the same codebase. It is the duty of experienced developers to fill their toolbox with both OOP and FP tools and to know from time to time how to choose and employ the tool that is the best fit for the problem at hand.",

      "abstract": "Poker Hands are are put into sequential order and the player who holds the highest one wins. Let’s make fun of it then and perform some refactorings of code that identifies what poker figure given player holds. We will transform a set of nested if-else statements into a nice chain of responsibility classes (Straight Flush, Four of a Kind, Full House, ...) . This way the chain of classes put into sequential order will figure out the score given player holds. Proxy design patterns will come into the picture as well.\n\nAll I can promise during this refactoring workshop is definitely no bluffing - just pure focus on code transformations. BTW : Did you know that real poker players are bluffing very rarely…? \n\nPrerequisite : become acquainted with poker rules if you haven’t played it so far, as business perspective and understanding existing code is the initial step for any refactoring. And don’t forget to install IntelliJ IDE - our master refactoring tool!",

      "title": "Reactive Spring",
      "abstract": "Microservices and big-data increasingly confront us with the limitations of traditional input/output. In traditional IO, work that is IO-bound dominates threads. This wouldn't be such a big deal if we could add more threads cheaply, but threads are expensive on the JVM, and most other platforms. Even if threads were cheap and infinitely scalable, we'd still be confronted with the faulty nature of networks. Things break, and they often do so in subtle, but non-exceptional ways. Traditional approaches to integration bury the faulty nature of networks behind overly simplifying abstractions. We need something better.\n\nSpring Framework 5 is here ! It introduces the Spring developer to a growing world of support for reactive programming across the Spring portfolio, starting with a new Netty-based web runtime, component model and module called Spring WebFlux, and then continuing to Spring Data Kay, Spring Security 5.0, Spring Boot 2.0 and Spring Cloud Finchley. Sure, it sounds like a lot, but don't worry! Join me, your guide, Spring developer advocate Josh Long, and we'll explore the wacky, wonderful world of Reactive Spring together.\n\n",

      "abstract": "It’s one thing to develop Java Enterprise applications, to execute, and validate them in test environments. Running the application in production, however, is a whole other story. Production life is harsh, unforgivable and the ultimate verification whether your application is able to add value to its users. Besides knowing the Java Enterprise APIs, developers therefore also need to know how to meet production requirements.\n\nThis session shows which non-functional requirements we enterprise developers need to be aware of to build stable and resilient applications. We will see different resiliency approaches, such as circuit breakers, bulkheads, or backpressure, in action. We will implement these concepts using the Java Enterprise API, MicroProfile, and certain Java EE extensions. Furthermore, we will see, how especially service meshes enable us to add resiliency to multiple microservices in a transparent, redundancy-free fashion.\n\nAdding telemetry to our applications is crucial to gather insights about the application under production load. We will see how to enhance our microservices with concerns such as monitoring, tracing, or logging in a minimalistic way.\n\nAll of the time will be spent live-demoing Java Enterprise applications that are deployed to an Istio cluster.",

This talk is looking for explore the aspects around IoT projects, Hardware, Security, Server Side, Data Analysis from the hand of Android Things and Kotlin.\n\nThe Internet of Things is a technology that has been echoing for some time. Arriving to generate interesting and attractive solutions. It usually happens that those who develop this type of solutions know about the Hardware, or they only have knowledge of the Software side. This talk seeks to explore all those aspects around IoT in the hand of a real project for monitoring fishbowls (something that you can implement at home). \n\nIn the hardware side, we will use sensors and different technologies for handle the information obtained from these (Raspberry PI, Arduino, etc). Since we want to show how to use Kotlin for develop IoT solutions, we will use Android Things with Kotlin and Raspberry PI. \n\nThe server side, using Serverless or IoT cloud solutions, options to analyze our information. Finally, is important take some considerations over the security aspects in IoT projects, although there are not yet 100% solid solutions, there are already efforts to solve this.",
