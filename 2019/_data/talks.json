      "abstract": "Object Oriented Programming dominated the software development landscape in the last decade of XX century and in the first of XXI. In more recent years, even as a consequence of the advent of multicore CPUs, Functional Programming and its principles started attracting more interest, becoming at least equally relevant in our industry. The biggest mistake made by programmers nowadays is considering OOP and FP as two mutually exclusive paradigms. This misconception is also the product of a misunderstanding about what OOP actually means and its founding principles. The biggest pros of OOP are polymorphism and encapsulation while FP strengths are immutabilty and its declarative style, but these features are orthogonal and there's no reason why they cannot coexist in the same program. The final purpose of this talk is twofold: debunking the misconceptions on OOP and showing that OOP and FP are actually complementary techniques that can happily coexist in the same codebase. It is the duty of experienced developers to fill their toolbox with both OOP and FP tools and to know from time to time how to choose and employ the tool that is the best fit for the problem at hand.",

      "abstract": "Poker Hands are are put into sequential order and the player who holds the highest one wins. Let’s make fun of it then and perform some refactorings of code that identifies what poker figure given player holds. We will transform a set of nested if-else statements into a nice chain of responsibility classes (Straight Flush, Four of a Kind, Full House, ...) . This way the chain of classes put into sequential order will figure out the score given player holds. Proxy design patterns will come into the picture as well.\n\nAll I can promise during this refactoring workshop is definitely no bluffing - just pure focus on code transformations. BTW : Did you know that real poker players are bluffing very rarely…? \n\nPrerequisite : become acquainted with poker rules if you haven’t played it so far, as business perspective and understanding existing code is the initial step for any refactoring. And don’t forget to install IntelliJ IDE - our master refactoring tool!",

This wouldn't be such a big deal if we could add more threads cheaply, but threads are expensive on the JVM, and most other platforms. Even if threads were cheap and infinitely scalable, we'd still be confronted with the faulty nature of networks. Things break, and they often do so in subtle, but non-exceptional ways. Traditional approaches to integration bury the faulty nature of networks behind overly simplifying abstractions. We need something better.\n\nSpring Framework 5 is here ! It introduces the Spring developer to a growing world of support for reactive programming across the Spring portfolio, starting with a new Netty-based web runtime, component model and module called Spring WebFlux, and then continuing to Spring Data Kay, Spring Security 5.0, Spring Boot 2.0 and Spring Cloud Finchley. Sure, it sounds like a lot, but don't worry! Join me, your guide, Spring developer advocate Josh Long, and we'll explore the wacky, wonderful world of Reactive Spring together.\n\n",

Production life is harsh, unforgivable and the ultimate verification whether your application is able to add value to its users. Besides knowing the Java Enterprise APIs, developers therefore also need to know how to meet production requirements.\n\nThis session shows which non-functional requirements we enterprise developers need to be aware of to build stable and resilient applications. We will see different resiliency approaches, such as circuit breakers, bulkheads, or backpressure, in action. We will implement these concepts using the Java Enterprise API, MicroProfile, and certain Java EE extensions. Furthermore, we will see, how especially service meshes enable us to add resiliency to multiple microservices in a transparent, redundancy-free fashion.\n\nAdding telemetry to our applications is crucial to gather insights about the application under production load. We will see how to enhance our microservices with concerns such as monitoring, tracing, or logging in a minimalistic way.\n\nAll of the time will be spent live-demoing Java Enterprise applications that are deployed to an Istio cluster.",

Join this critical review of the major decisions taken in a typical enterprise application architecture and learn to balance pragmatism with your design goals. Find out how to do just-in-time design to keep as much use-cases as simple as possible.\n\n\nThe core purpose of this presentation is to learn to strike a **balance between pragmatism and maintainability** in your design. Without continuous refactoring, a simple design will inevitably degenerate into a Big Ball of Mud, under the assault of the new features and bugfixes. On the other hand, very highly-factored code can burden the take-off of the development and end up freezing the mindset in some rigid 'a-priori' design.\n\nThe end goal of this talk is to challenge you to rethink critically the architecture of your own systems, and seek ways to simplify it to match your actual needs, with a pragmatic mindset.\n\n\"Architecture is the art of postponing decisions\", said Uncle Bob. This talk takes this idea further and explains an optimal mindset about designing enterprise applications: Evolving (Continuously Refactoring) a Pragmatic (Simple), Clean (aka Onion) Architecture, aiming to provide Developer Safety™️ and Comfort™️. It’s the philosophy that Victor distilled over the past 5 years, designing and implementing 9 applications as IBM Lead Architect, and delivering trainings and advises to many other companies.\n\nYou’ll learn how to break data into pieces (Fit Entities, Value Objects, Data Transfer Objects), how to keep the logic simple (Facades, Domain Services, logic extraction patterns, Mappers, AOP), layering to enforce boundaries (keeping DTOs out of your logic, Dependency Inversion Principle), and many more, all in a dynamic, interactive and extremely entertaining session.\n",

      "abstract": "TLDR: The big discussion:  Kotlin or Java, to migrate or not to migrate and why...\n\nThe world of languages on the JVM has seen alternatives to Java come and go. Kotlin is probably the most popular one at this moment. Although Java is still one of the most commonly used programming languages, Kotlin seems to keep growing very fast. Where Java is known for its verbosity, Kotlin aims at making programming easier. On the other hand, Kotlin is a mix of paradigms and forces you to learn yet another language. Moreover, with all the new features that are rapidly introduced in Java, is Kotlin actually needed? So what are the aspects where they differ from each other? In which situations should we choose the one or the other?  Should we migrate to Kotlin or is Java good enough? As Kotlin claims full interoperability with Java, should we even choose?\nIn this talk we will fire up the battle between Kotlin and Java. In this battle one of us will root for Java while the other cheers for Kotlin. Who wins? That is totally up to you. The audience will be judge and jury. So...bring it on.\n",

In this talk, we'll look at how to test imperative components, reactive data flows, and mocks. We’ll examine how to take advantage of test slices, and how to test web applications. We'll look at how to ensure that API producers and consumers work well together using consumer driven contract testing without sacrificing the testing pyramid for end-to-end integration tests.

Agile retrospectives are a great practice for helping teams to reflect on what’s going well and what could be better, and identify opportunities for improvement and change.  Retrospectives within teams helps to encourage self organisation, management and improvement. Introduction to Retrospectives: Formats for running Retrospectives, Practical exercises – Retrospective Sailing Game, Facilitating a Retrospective, Outcomes and Measures using Retrospectives. Retrospective Sailing is an agile reflection game demonstrated in this hands-on workshop. You can play as an individual in any role, as part of a development team, or with clients and customers to help understand how your journey is going. It will give you a new, fun way to run a retrospective to help to gain your bearings, identify what’s putting the wind in your sails, the anchors holding you back, and discover hidden treasure. Then you’ll plot your course and map a way forward that raises those anchors and catches the tide and a fair wind. You will be introduced to the game and try it out. There will be case examples and tips for facilitating the game too. Join us for some constructive fun, practical outcomes, and a useful tool to take back to the office. Helping teams embed continuous reflection and improvement into their work. Retrospective Sailing helps teams to reflect and map their way forward easily, in a fun, tactile and visual way. Review what's going well, what could go better, and ensure you are responding regularly to the changing horizon.",
