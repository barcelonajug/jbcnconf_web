                                <h1>Morning (9:00 to 14:00)</h1> 
         - A training event for 50 teenagers (around 16 yo) covering Web and Video Game programming
                                
                                <h3>Web Programming</h3>
    <p>
        Involve students in an active way with the conference through the code and an activity whose result is an approximation to an informative blog about the JBCN in which the activity takes place. <br>

        We will start by introducing the language with general concepts and seeing its main applications in real life.

        There will be several teams, each group will be responsible for making a different kind of page about the event: stands, sponsors, some talks with the info of the person who gives it, where to buy tickets ...

        We will start preparing the main structure of the blog by deciding the header, type of font and colors. Each team must take into account the information that will be transmitted to give a different environment to the page.

        The blog must be professional so we will add photos and videos of the event and, finally, we will link all the pages made by the different groups in a main page of the event that will serve as HOME and we will insert the links to the different sections.
<br>
<br>
        <b>Schedule :</b><br>
        
        <b>15’:</b> Introduction to the programming language<br>
        <b>45’:</b> With some teams, each one will be in charge of creating a web page for the conference<br>
    with info related to stands, sponsors, tals, speakers BIO ...<br>
    We'll start preparing the main blog structure defining headers, font types and colors. <br>
    Every team has to take into account the information they want to share to think about the style and also to get all the information required<br>
        <b>35’:</b> Blog should be professional so they will add pictures, videos, etc<br>
        <b>20’:</b> In the end we'll link all created blogs adding hyperlinks <br>
        <b>5’:</b> Summary and QA.

        <h3>Video Game Programming</h3>
    <p>
        Contact with a powerful videogame development tool that seeks to offer students a satisfactory programming experience by understanding the environment and using programming to adapt the video game to their liking.

        There will be an introduction to Roblox and the type of language it uses, what it is, how it works and we will see its applications.
        Next, we will analyze the environment of Roblox and we will see how to import games to the Studio that we will complete to see firsthand what tools this program offers us.
        To end the videogame, we will add characters of all kinds and thanks to the programming language Lua, we will add functions such as running, jumping, moving ... we will put enemies and traps to our character that we will also program.

        <b>15 ':</b> There will be an introduction to Roblox and the type of language it uses, what it is, how it works and we will see its applications.<br>
        <b>25 ':</b> Next, we will analyze and learn about the Roblox environment and its available tools with practical guided exercises.<br>
        <b>35 ':</b> We will see how to import games to the Studio. We will analyze the components of the games and the entire structure behind a video game. We will use this basic video game to program it to<br>
        our taste and know what tools this program offers us.<br>
        <b>45 ':</b> This part will be dedicated to adding new characters and thanks to the programming language Lua, we will add functions such as running, jumping, moving ... we will put enemies and traps to our character that we will also have to program.<br>

        <b>Talk by Ubisoft</b>
    <p>
        Game development is not too different from other software creation... or is it? In game development, a software coder finds many different roles not ever seen in any other industry, such as game and economy designers, concept/2D/3D artists, live ops, tech programmers, producers, and of course the always present Client+Server engineers (Frontend+Backend). With such as heterogeneous ecosystem, a +2 years development of a project becomes an interesting journey across many iterations and ideas, always full of challenges and passion. For further knowledge about all these roles and the interaction between them, we will review a postmortem of an already developed game in the Ubisoft Barcelona Mobile studio, discovering how so many professionals work together from the very first day until the world wide launch (and beyond).

       <h1>Afternoon (14:00 to 16:00)</h1>
         - A training event for 40 kids ( around 9 yo ) covering Scratch programming and Lego WeDo robots

       <h3>Scratch programming and Lego WeDo</h3>
                                
        <p>
            Introduce students in the world of robotics while learning how to apply mechanics to the world of electronics solving and programming a reverse engineering challenge.

            We will start analyzing what is robotics and where we can find robots in our day to day. We will see real examples where students will know what processes are performed today by machines thanks to mechatronics. In groups, we will pose a challenge of reverse engineering where the students will only have an image where different robotic arms will be shown. We will analyze the transmission of the movement through gears and belts so that later they apply this theory in their constructions. We will finish the activity by programming the electronic part of the prototype and testing its operation.
