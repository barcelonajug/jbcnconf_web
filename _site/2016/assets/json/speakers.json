With the development of the Apache Cordova Platform and the framework Ionic, this situation has completely changed as a developer can now design a project using their favorite HTML5, Javascript, AngularJS frameworks and rely on the tool provided by Apache Codova to generate the HTML Hybrid code for the target platform. The purpose of this talk is to demonstrate how such Mobile project can be designed and being integrated with a Backend System which is a REST Camel microservice. Next, we will also explain how we can simplify the Management and the packaging of the NodeJS application used to access the backend service using the Feedhenry Mobile Application platform and its Api.",

A lot of organizations that are looking to deploy microservices are running into the following problems: how to test, how to deploy, VM proliferation, how to manage, and ultimately how to get services to integrate in a reliable way. Fuse Integration Services for OpenShift is a Docker/Kubernetes-native way of packaging our microservices and leveraging powerful integration technology built on Apache Camel to do connect the pieces together. After that, how do you build, manage and continuously deploy your microserivces? With another open-source project, fabric8.io, we can hook into well-known CI/CD tools like github, jenkins, nexus, et al, and build out end to end  pipelines with promotion and approval processes that can be customized to suit your projects and organizations needs. CI/CD also integrates with LetsChat/Slack/Ryver using Hubot automation to deliver transparency and control to enable organizations to practice ChatOps. Once you've got your microservices being built and deployed, leverage the built-in API Management, middleware visualization console, chaos monkey, and centralized logging/metrics/monitoring to operationalize your services and ensure they stay resilient.",

Knowledge Is Everything - that’s a slogan that lots of business domains is catching up right now.On the other hand, recent trends in software development are shifting into micro services environments where loosely coupled, standalone and independent services provide access to various business assets. With that in mind, knowledge driven micro service idea came into live to combine couple of great technologies together to satisfy such needs:- vert.x - toolkit for building reactive applications on JVM- jBPM and Drools flexible process and rule engines that provide excellent execution environment for business assets - the knowledge- hazelcast - in memory data grid- various programming languages (Java, JavaScript, Scala, Groovy) to attract various development teams. This session is about illustrating how easily and fast you can build knowledge driven micro services and scale them to almost no limits. All in reactive and polyglot fashion with powerful clustering. Scale individual knowledge micro services without a hassle and allow various languages to easily interact with business knowledge without a need to know where they are located. It all goes via clustered event bus provided by Vert.x, backed by deployable knowledge archives provided by jBPM and Drools, clustering delivered by hazelcast data grid and allow polyglot client side access.It’s all about business knowledge that can be delivered as software solution with:- flexibility - speed of development - isolated scalability - manageability . Come and see how to transform your IT solutions into knowledge driven micro services with Vert.x, jBPM, Drools and Hazelcast. This session will be full of life demos to actually show the running micro services driven by business knowledge.",

The ease of use led you to experiment writing your own Dockerfile and building images from it. You tried Docker Compose. You might have realized benefits Docker provides in conjunction with microservices. Hopefully, you already deployed a container or two to production or, at least, recognized the advantages it brings to development, testing, integration and other environments and phases. All those pieces are necessary requirements for the 'real deal'. The final objective is to combine quite a few processes and technologies that will allow us to create a deployment pipeline. Docker makes it possible to reach nirvana. The world many thought is far from reality. The world where the last thing we do is run git push. From thereon, a machine takes over, and few minutes later our software is tested, built, deployed to production, and what so not. Let's see how that nirvana looks like. Let's explore which steps are required for a fully automated continuous deployment pipeline combined with microservices, and Docker containers.",

You will see how we can build small discrete microservices with these Java technologies and build and deploy on the Kubernets/OpenShift3 container platform. We will discuss practices how to build distributed and fault tolerant microservices using technologies such as Kubernetes Services, Camel EIPs, Netflixx Hysterix, and Ribbon. We will use Zipkin service tracing across all four Java based microservices to provide a visualization of timings and help highlight latency problems in our mesh of microservices. And the self healing and fault tolerant aspects of the Kubernetes/OpenShift3 platform is also discussed and demoed when we let the chaos monkeys loose killing containers.

Even though, people love them. People don't love mutants. 'Mutant' is such a negative word. Even if you find a really cool mutants, like Spiderman or Wolverine, we call them superheros. It just sounds better. But when you look at them they have great powers that can be used for great things. But nope, people don't love mutants. IT people are much smarter and prefer mutants over zombies. How many zombie test we have in our systems? Tests, that don't check anything, fail in the worst moment, consume resources and time? Do we even know where they are and how many of them there is exactly? Not really, and here mutants can help. And to be more precise - mutation testing. In my presentation I would like to talk about mutation testing and how they affect the quality of both the code and tests. During live coding session I would like to present lightweight and easy to introduce framework PITest, which I consider to be the best available solution for mutation testing.",

        "abstract": "Balance, this is the word we can hear in lots of places but not too often in software development. But what balance can you talk about in our industry? What is the balance we need/ How can we achieve it? Marketing people needs to have a product they can sell, developers needs to have a product that is easy and nice to work with. How can we take care of this balance? Who should take care of it? Can developers only complain 'if only I had more time I would write unit tests... / I would take care of the design / the code would be in better shape...'? Did you hear such complaints next to your desk? So what can we do about the above? It is enough to be a good developer or do we need something more? In my workshop I would like to talk about Effective Refactoring. Effective Refactoring joins two things : hand­on refactoring and talk about effectiveness. Refactoring is a mean to achieve the balance between production (clients receives working product) and production capability (developers are able to extend the product and deliver new functionality). Effectiveness is the mental approach to achieving our goals. Only when you join them you can act reasonably. My goal is to encourage people to change the approach to work by refactoring when needed, by making it everyday practice or a habit. Each of us want to be happy at work. We want to be motivated but do we take care of it? We want to have good quality code, covered by tests, object oriented but what we really do in order achieve it? I would like to show 7 Habits of Highly Effective People presented by Stephen Covey in his best seller and how they can be applied to software engineering. Here are they. Be proactive Are you waiting for things to be done and complaining? Are you part of the solution or part of the problem? 'It’s not me ­ it’s the team'. Did you hear this complaint? Start with end in mind Do you ask yourself questions : what I am doing? how should I do this? why I am doing it this way? What will be the outcome of my decisions in the near future? Did I really saved time if I skipped refactoring and quality because the product 'is working'? Importance before urgency Certainly sometimes we need to put off the fire at work. But what kind of a motivator it is? 'Must do it' vs 'want do it' are two different approaches and if you want to use the latter approach you need to to really proactive and minimize the number of fires. Then you will have more freedom to take care of your code. Think Win ­ Win or No Deal What is your approach to collaborators? Do you perceive your (product) managers / marketing as competitors (time vs quality) or members of one team that drives together towards the success? Understand before being understood How to approach dealing with legacy code? Do you just add you new functionality or consider refactoring before or after this? What you do before you decide to improve the design? Do you want to understand the current state before proposing / imposing your changes? Introduce synergy Do you understand the difference between compromise and synergy when two people have different opinions and want to achieve agreement? Team can benefit a lot if people are looking together for 'third solutions' instead of competing. Sharpen the SawDo you take care of yourself so you are able to make it better? Do you know the areas of yourself to grow (physical, mental, emotional, spiritual dimensions). Do you know that sometimes to be better in refactoring is to stop refactoring?",

        "abstract": "You need to experience to understand. You need to teach to grow. Therefore in order to grow your refactoring skills you need to see it, experience it, understand it, share your ideas with others, try it yourself,try it in a group and finally encourage, teach others! During this 2 hours slot (with a break of course as nobody can keep concentrated for such time) I would like to do some live­refactoring ­ interactively with the audience. I will present pyramid of refactoring (the concept I’ve created based on lots of ideas I’ve read), and show how I teach to apply it into real code. We will use Java and IntelliJ’s automated refactorings. The codebase will be really small. This way we can quickly understand it and turn it upside down as long / as much as we want. We will start from the simplest refactorings, and step by step go into more sophisticated ones. Extracting new classes, applying Single Responsibility Principle (or the whole SOLID) will lead us towards emerging Design Patterns, reusability and testability of our classes. I do want to show that refactoring is like a game: try and see if given refactoring leads to better quality. Maybe this way, maybe not. Each trial is a lesson. When we fail then we draw conclusions and try again in order to succeed. I will prove also very quickly, why we run into one of two extremes so that refactoring does not happen to your code : ­ Hmm.... The code is so simple (not that bad yet), so why should I refactor it?­ Oh no! The code is so horrible that I do not want to work with it any longer.... and want to change the job /team. But Isn’t you the one who made it (as least partly) so bad? Effective Refactoring joins two things : hand­on refactoring and talk about effectiveness.

The physical devices, layout and algorithms we use affect cost, efficiency and site capacity – getting it right is worth millions.<br>Making highly optimal choices for these three aspects is often beyond human capability. We can either optimise and test by trial and error in production, which is expensive, risky and slow, or we can write software to test our systems and identify highly optimal choices for us.<br>Learn how we use Discrete Event Simulation to test production applications, predict operational performance, and optimise physical layouts, hardware design and control algorithms. Discrete Event Simulation gives us scenario and full production case testing capability. These tests are deterministic, making debugging faster and simpler, and preventing erroneous test failures. Each test can complete faster than real-time meaning that you can afford to add a vast amount of tests without excessively slowing down your development cycle.  Come along and I’ll show you how this can be done.",

To solve this problem, we have created Walkmod, an open source tool to share and automatically fix code conventions.<br>In this session we will introduce Walkmod and  we will explain how to configure it to automatically fix our sonar rules using one of the most important java open source project.",

Although many technologies/specifications exist currently and can be implemented like WS-Security, WS-SecurityPolicy, WS-Trust, SAML, Oauth2, OpenID Connect  to secure the endpoints, they require strong Security skills from the Java developers and unfortunately this approach doesn't fit very well in a MicroService architecture running potentially hundred of endpoints and where we have to manage also hundreds of certificates. During this talk, you will see and discover how you can leverage the advantages to use an API Management platform to enforce the security of your REST endpoints and externalize such management process. WE will also demonstrate how we can discover the services/endpoints deployed within the different namespaces, define the security of the endpoints and the policies to be applied. This security enforcement will be designed using some of the policies available to authenticate or authorize the MicroService Application running in a Linux Container using Basic Auth, Oauth2 and Roles.

There is something not being addressed though, like if it is some kind of dirty little secret, and that is frontend development. The common practice for building websites remains 'the monolith': a single frontend codebase that consumes multiple APIs. We believe we found a better solution.Last year, a handful of Zalando engineers came up with an innovative solution for this exact problem - project Mosaic. Mosaic is a new architecture for websites where microservices are used in the entire stack, all the way to the frontend.Its main components are:<br><ul style='text-align : left'><li>- Skipper - an HTTP router with runtime update of routes</li><li>- Tailor - a streaming layout service with runtime update of templates</li></ul><p class='abstract'>The network is the glue putting it all together.In this talk we want to share our motivation to build Mosaic, how to perform such migration without downtime, and the advantages it has to offer to other organizations, regardless of their size.We'll go through the operational details about Skipper and how it can be customized to answer many other different requirements. I'll also describe in detail how Tailor can dramatically improve the perceived performance of your website by streaming frontend content, from multiple fragments, in parallel.</p>",

The RESTful famework contains a Java Content Repository (JCR) standard (JSR 283) implemented as Apache JackRabbit. <br>The talk includes some live code examples, that will review the most key and important phases of development such as testing (unit, integration testing and automatic health checks), deployment in an OSGi environment, surviving web penetration tests for web components, caching strategy and performance for multi-language and region sites, error handling for forms, templates, and components, content hierarchies for organizing different content types, solutions for responsiveness and mobile support, and integration with web templating tools; for example, javascript, Sightly (another Apache Open Source project), and Granite (the hypermedia driven UI that allows for a modular way of building components).The introduction covers the essential Sling and how the REST framework is based on interpreting the (HTTP) request. <br>The center of the framework is the mapping of each resource to an internal representation that is flexible. It explains how scripts are resolved as part of the request and what extra benefits there are to ease development; for example, how to leverage inheritance in certain content hierarchies. The main objective is to show how resources and representations are modeled in the server.The presentation aims to be highly practical, focusing on those aspects of enterprise java systems that deal with Web Content Management and in which the complexity of the different types of pages served, the need for performance, the multinational and multi-lingual rollout are key factors of success.",
