But this doesn't scratch the same developer itch that Java 8's lambdas and streams did, and we're left with a vague sensation that the next version might not be that interesting. Java 9 actually has a lot of great additions and changes to make development a bit nicer.  These features can't be lumped under an umbrella term like Java 8's lambdas and streams, the changes are scattered throughout the APIs and language features that we regularly use. In this presentation Trisha will show, via live coding:<br> - How we can use the new Flow API to utilise Reactive Programming <br> - How the improvements to the Streams API make it easier to control real-time streaming data <br> - How to the Collections convenience methods simplify code<br> Along the way we'll bump into other Java 9 features, including some of the additions to interfaces and changes to deprecation.  We’ll see that once you start using Java 9, you can't go back to Before.",

You’ll learn the concepts behind Vert.x, why we chose Vert.x, how we’re using it and the challenges we faced. Topics include the anatomy of our projects, (micro)services architecture, deployment model and DevOps, scalability, the upgrade from Vert.x 2 to Vert.x 3 and cooperation with the team behind Vert.x.

In this talk, we’ll take a real-world example from a web scale system. This system is targeted at 10 million users and has around 400 heterogeneous backends.

We'll convince you that you don't need to manage many different services by yourself to have a true Cloud Native application. You can rely on Kubernetes services to solve most of the problems.

That's a lot to digest… This session helps you understanding what's behind the 'reactive' word. It explores the reactive landscape and explains what all these 'things' are and how they are related. Attendees don't only learn what does 'reactive' mean, but also how it is related to their projects and applications. By providing a global overview of the reactive landscape, this session also provides to the attendees a general understanding of the 'reactive' trend, and why it matters. The presentation uses several live coding demos to explain the different concepts. It uses Eclipse Vert.x as a playground to explain how all these concepts work together. Eclipse Vert.x is a toolkit to build reactive and distributed systems on the JVM. It supports a set of languages such as Java, JavaScript, Ceylon, Scala and Kotlin… but also a set of programming styles (callbacks, futures, streams, RX...). It covers a large part of the reactive spectrum making it a great choice to implement reactive applications and systems.",

But just splitting the codebase, creating APIs and deploying the code on some servers is not enough, somehow your services need to know where and how other services are accessible. Classical approaches like hardcoding everything in every service or having a central load-balancer can quickly lead to problems in terms of scalability and maintainability. In this talk I'll show how we at ResearchGate tackled this challenge. With the help of tools like Consul, linkerd and Kubernetes we created a setup that allows us to quickly boot and shutdown services. This ensures that all servers are utilized optimally and load spikes can be reacted upon quickly and automatically.",

You will meet commonly used patterns like 'Configuration Container, 'DNS Service Lookup', 'Dockerfile Template' or the famous 'Sidecar Pattern', but also some more esoteric recipes like the 'Wormhole' pattern.

In this presentation we will build a simple robot and connect to it remotely, receiving data and sending instructions over the internet. Just like the Pathfinder spacecraft and its Sojourner Mars rover, our little robot will boldly travel into uncharted territory. In a live demo, our robot will explore the session room and transmit all kinds of sensor data. We will visualise that data in a web UI. With the Mars robot use case, we explore the capabilities of the Amazon IoT platform. AWS IoT comes with easy to use APIs and arranges secure communication with our robot. It also provides neat features like a rules engine and ‘device shadow’. Even when our robot is offline, device shadow makes it very easy to retrieve its latest status. And last but not least, for small scale use, AWS IoT is free to try out. Are you curious about how to connect your devices to the cloud? Take this journey and find out if this mission will lead to new discoveries.",

Also the resulting environment due to its moving parts requires to have a solid mechanism to trace logs and metrics as liaising with sysadmins is out of the equation. We propose a solution that aims at minimising the time-to-market by providing an ecosystem that is able to help developers and QA ́s to deliver fast and quality code focusing on coding itself and not in the infrastructure or the setting up of the environment required. In this workshop we'll introduce how at atSistemas we tackle this problem by providing a fully-automated open-sourced CI stack where containers are first-class citizens. In the session we´ll talk about docker, Gitlab, Jenkins, SonarQube, Nexus, Selenium, Kubernetes, Graylog and Prometheus among others. We'll also cover and apply some common quality standards in the building stages, run all sort of tests, promote images, orchestrate deployments and monitoring logs and metrics.",

Your responsibility as an engineer or product manager in your company is to deliver value to your customers by cohesive and performant solutions.<br/>Have you ever asked yourself any of the following questions?<br/> - How do I know that my team is delivering what our customers want? <br/> - How much intuition do I use to develop requirements and solutions?<br/> - How do I ensure that our solutions are performant and scalable in all situations?<br/> - Am I sure that users are using our features with the frequency that we expected?<br/>The common approach in software development is to adopt a reactive attitude towards the previous points: deliver the functionality to production, wait for customer feedback (if any) and just wait for issues and bugs to be raised by the customer. No bugs? No customer feedback? Everything is ok!<br/>Unfortunately, the reactive approach is not scalable in an enterprise environment and will not help your team much to deliver valuable solutions to your customers.In the new cloud computing era, we have a great opportunity to change our mindset and move to a proactive approach where software development teams can immediately know what's going on in production and design new functionality based on customer's behavior and data. No more intuition-driven designs!<br/>In this session, we will explore how feature instrumentation through ElasticSearch and Kibana can help cloud enterprises to change to a proactive approach: anticipate problems, get real insights about feature usage and empower their teams to own their features even after they are released to production. We will also explore how ElasticSearch can be used by multiple teams with the least friction possible and how to incorporate instrumentation as another milestone in the software development lifecycle just like requirements gathering or testing.Just think about it, keep calm and watch Kibana ;)",

Spock tests are called specifications and we write specifications with a Groovy DSL. The DSL enforces a certain way to define the specifications, which results in better readable and maintainable test code. First we learn about the DSL Spock uses. We can write for example test methods and simply use a sentence as a method name. Also we use labels to define fixed sections each test needs. Spock support data driven testing, where we can invoke a method under test multiple times and each time with a different value. We can define the data in data providers, like lists or database rows and with data tables. To write a mock or stub we don’t need an external library. Spock has support built-in and with a very concise syntax. We learn about this syntax and see how clean our test code will be.",
