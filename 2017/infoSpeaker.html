But just splitting the codebase, creating APIs and deploying the code on some servers is not enough, somehow your services need to know where and how other services are accessible. Classical approaches like hardcoding everything in every service or having a central load-balancer can quickly lead to problems in terms of scalability and maintainability. In this talk I'll show how we at ResearchGate tackled this challenge. With the help of tools like Consul, linkerd and Kubernetes we created a setup that allows us to quickly boot and shutdown services. This ensures that all servers are utilized optimally and load spikes can be reacted upon quickly and automatically.","tags":["Kubernetes","Microservices","Devops"],"level":"Intermediate","file":"Bastian HOFFMAN ok.mp4","video":"WA4siaFXuBw","scheduleId":"#MON-TC2-SE4","speakers":["bastian-hofman"]})

Also the resulting environment due to its moving parts requires to have a solid mechanism to trace logs and metrics as liaising with sysadmins is out of the equation. We propose a solution that aims at minimising the time-to-market by providing an ecosystem that is able to help developers and QA's to deliver fast and quality code focusing on coding itself and not in the infrastructure or the setting up of the environment required. In this workshop we'll introduce how at atSistemas we tackle this problem by providing a fully-automated open-sourced CI stack where containers are first-class citizens. In the session we´ll talk about docker, Gitlab, Jenkins, SonarQube, Nexus, Selenium, Kubernetes, Graylog and Prometheus among others.

While being easier to deploy and isolate, containerized applications are creating new challenges for the logging and monitoring systems. This talk looks into the details about how the Elastic Stack, and in particular Beats — lightweight shippers — are gathering data from containers. The session shows our way to: fetch logs from containers, collect different measurements from cgroups, collect metrics using the Docker API, enhance the data with the metadata of the containers, monitor the network traffic exchanged between containers, collect metrics from the underlying host. We conclude the talk with a live demo of all the components in action.","tags":["Docker","Elastic","Beats","Monitoring"],"level":"Intermediate","file":"Philipp Krenn ok.mp4","video":"AHs2djYeHX4","scheduleId":"#MON-TC2-SE5","speakers":["philipp-krenn"]})

Your responsibility as an engineer or product manager in your company is to deliver value to your customers by cohesive and performant solutions.<br/>Have you ever asked yourself any of the following questions?<br/> - How do I know that my team is delivering what our customers want? <br/> - How much intuition do I use to develop requirements and solutions?<br/> - How do I ensure that our solutions are performant and scalable in all situations?<br/> - Am I sure that users are using our features with the frequency that we expected?<br/>The common approach in software development is to adopt a reactive attitude towards the previous points: deliver the functionality to production, wait for customer feedback (if any) and just wait for issues and bugs to be raised by the customer. No bugs? No customer feedback? Everything is ok!<br/>Unfortunately, the reactive approach is not scalable in an enterprise environment and will not help your team much to deliver valuable solutions to your customers.In the new cloud computing era, we have a great opportunity to change our mindset and move to a proactive approach where software development teams can immediately know what's going on in production and design new functionality based on customer's behavior and data. No more intuition-driven designs!<br/>In this session, we will explore how feature instrumentation through ElasticSearch and Kibana can help cloud enterprises to change to a proactive approach: anticipate problems, get real insights about feature usage and empower their teams to own their features even after they are released to production. We will also explore how ElasticSearch can be used by multiple teams with the least friction possible and how to incorporate instrumentation as another milestone in the software development lifecycle just like requirements gathering or testing.Just think about it, keep calm and watch Kibana ;)","tags":["Kibana","ElasticSearch","Instrumentation","Cloud"],"level":"Intermediate","file":"ALBERT MARGARIT OK.mp4","video":"swDnvmCMHwo","scheduleId":"#MON-TC4-SE5","speakers":["albert-margarit"]})

We can use Spock to write test code for testing Java and Groovy code. Spock tests are called specifications and we write specifications with a Groovy DSL. The DSL enforces a certain way to define the specifications, which results in better readable and maintainable test code. First we learn about the DSL Spock uses. We can write for example test methods and simply use a sentence as a method name. Also we use labels to define fixed sections each test needs. Spock support data driven testing, where we can invoke a method under test multiple times and each time with a different value. We can define the data in data providers, like lists or database rows and with data tables. To write a mock or stub we don't need an external library. Spock has support built-in and with a very concise syntax. We learn about this syntax and see how clean our test code will be.","tags":["Spock","Tests","Groovy"],"level":"Beginner","file":"Hubert Klein OK.mp4","video":"YzhIyF836-A","scheduleId":"#TUE-TC2-SE4","speakers":["hubert-klein-ikkink"]})

So then, why shouldn't you use them in developing your enterprise application? It's absurd to keep away from these exponents, but at some point you may start having some weird feeling about them. And then you get to your first code review, and you start wondering... How do the 'Clean Code' principles change, when you jump on Lambdas? How should you use Lambdas while keeping a clean maintainable codebase - the ultimate goal of any java enterprise application.<br/> We'll remember how a clean function should look like, as stated in the Clean Code 'bible' by Uncle Bob, and then we'll see how these principles change when you throw Lambdas in. We'll try to figure out together some guidelines you should you keep in mind when playing with fire (oups,sorry.. Lambdas) in your enterprise application code.<br/> Then, we'll walk together through some Lambdas code samples, from the most trivial to the more mind-stretching, following an order inferred from a little study I'm running. This way, you'll see that the adoption of Lambdas and Streams can become a gradual process, that would allow your developers to master the functional thinking bit-by-bit.<br/> The talk will leave you with a lot of take-aways: hints, tips, warnings, useful even if you don't have practical experience with Lambdas.

This session looks at what is in and what is out of the Java 9 release and whether the features *really* benefit a developer. We'll discuss questions like whether Java 9 will be as useful to a developer as Java 8 was? How will libraries and frameworks make use of the modularity framework? How will applications benefit, or not, from the new default garbage collector? This session cuts through the hype to outline how Java 9 will realistically affect the everyday pragmatic developer and looks forward to what we can expect in future releases.<br/><br/><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Requirements for the workshop</span>: <a href=\"https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/jdk9-jigsaw\" style=\"text-decoration: underline; color: blue;\" target=\"_blank\">Clone this repo and follow their instructions</a>","tags":["Java9","modularity"],"level":"Beginner","file":".mp4","video":"","scheduleId":"#WED-TC1-SE2","speakers":["simon-maple"]})

There are multiple approaches to testing microservices. Unit tests help, but if we want to test a microservice as a whole, we'll have to use integration testing. In this talk, I will use REST-assured, a framework using a Java DSL, to test against the REST interface of a microservice. REST-assured is a 100% java REST testing solution that integrates nicely with other tools such as JUnit. I will also show how this compares with other solutions, for example Cucumber in combination with custom glue code, and Spring integration tests.","tags":["test","microservices","restassured"],"level":"Beginner","file":"Michael Schudel OK.mp4","video":"-d2IxHXOnKs","scheduleId":"#TUE-TC3-SE6","speakers":["michel-schudel"]})
